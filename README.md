# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java and its solution.

The `bug.java` file contains code that produces the exception. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version.

The error arises from an off-by-one error in the loop condition of a for loop iterating over an array.  The loop attempts to access an index that is beyond the valid range of indices for the array.
